# ThriftOnlineDjangoSite
Functioning e-commerce site using django and a little bit of Vue.js

This is my e-commerce site, which I made using Django and Vue.js.
This store is for second-hand clothes, which are really really cheap, maybe with some defects, which will be posted in the site for transperency.


I have hosted it for a while, however not posted any products. The point of the site was to get into django, python and e-commerce business
